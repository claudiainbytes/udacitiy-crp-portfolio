        <p>Ever since Dua Lipa's video for "New Rules" dropped, people have been trying to live by Dua's modern-day commandments.</p>

      <div class="content">

        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/article1.jpg" srcset="img/srcset/article1-xs-2x.jpg 480w, img/srcset/article1-s-2x.jpg 768w, img/srcset/article1-m-2x.jpg 1024w, img/srcset/article1-l-2x.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 480px, (max-width: 768px) 768px, (max-width: 1024px) 1024px, (max-width: 1280px) 1280px" alt="article1">

        <p>On this week’s Hot 100, “New Rules” reaches a new peak at No. 38, up six spots from the last tally; meanwhile, its video has surpassed the 450 million mark on YouTube, more than four times as many as the “Blow Your Mind (Mwah)” clip. “It’s been surreal, and really exciting,” Lipa adds. "I was very excited to shoot the video, because I’d come up with this concept that I was really proud of and that I thought that would be something that would attract people’s attention but it also kind of gave the song a different meaning. … I just didn’t expect it to do this. Like, I thought people were gonna like it, but I didn’t think it was gonna become a meme.”</p>

        <p>Yes, Dua Lipa has seen the “New Rules” memes — the many GIFs pulled straight from the video, but also the parodies it has inspired. Her favorite is this one, where the lyrics become a how-to guide for surviving a horror movie. She also loves Jake Wilson’s all-male “Boy Version”; the parody, posted one week after “New Rules," has 6 million views on its own.</p>
