        <p>"I want people to see a piece of me. I want people to have an insight into everything that's happened over the last few years while I was writing the album and actually really get to know me. It's been good because when I released 'New Love' and 'Be The One', I had people say, 'That really relates to me'."</p>

        <p>"I want people to have that feeling and I want people to know that they're not alone in all this and that we all go through the same fucking shit. That's the main goal. For this album I want to be as truthful as possible, then all the club shit can come later."</p>
