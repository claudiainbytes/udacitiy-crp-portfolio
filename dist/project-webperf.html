In 1955, it reopened as the Crown Hotel and later was converted into a three-tower apartment building. The hotel operated as Thompson Miami Beach from November 2014 through April 2016.</p><p>The Unbound Collection by Hyatt provides guests with social currency and story-worthy experiences. With that in mind, The Confidante provides a playful and sophisticated backdrop, much like a friend’s beach house, where guests can get away and relax while enjoying the vibrancy and energy of Miami Beach.</p><p>Situated as an oasis in close proximity to South Beach, The Confidante features 30 suites, two restaurants -- the Asian-American TALDE Miami Beach and Bird & Bone -- two heated swimming pools, direct beach access, a rooftop spa, a full service salon by Warren-Tricomi, an indoor/outdoor fitness experience, in-room dining, a craft cocktail bar, and a lush tropical garden. It also houses approximately 35,000+ square feet of indoor and outdoor flexible, multi-functional venue space.</p></div><footer><p>&copy; Web Performance 2014 <span id="crp-stats"></span></p></footer></div></body></html>
