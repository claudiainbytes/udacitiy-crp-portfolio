        <p>With deep historical roots in Miami Beach, The Confidante is a three-towered property that pays homage to the vibrant feeling of the city in the 1950s. </p>

        <img src="img/theconfidante.jpg">

        <p>Serving at one time as the tallest modern building in Miami Beach, The Confidante originally opened as the 18-floor Lord Tarleton Hotel on Collins Avenue, making headlines and representing a boom for the city’s economy. In 1955, it reopened as the Crown Hotel and later was converted into a three-tower apartment building. The hotel operated as Thompson Miami Beach from November 2014 through April 2016.</p>

        <p>The Unbound Collection by Hyatt provides guests with social currency and story-worthy experiences. With that in mind, The Confidante provides a playful and sophisticated backdrop, much like a friend’s beach house, where guests can get away and relax while enjoying the vibrancy and energy of Miami Beach.</p>

        <p>Situated as an oasis in close proximity to South Beach, The Confidante features 30 suites, two restaurants -- the Asian-American TALDE Miami Beach and Bird & Bone -- two heated swimming pools, direct beach access, a rooftop spa, a full service salon by Warren-Tricomi, an indoor/outdoor fitness experience, in-room dining, a craft cocktail bar, and a lush tropical garden. It also houses approximately 35,000+ square feet of indoor and outdoor flexible, multi-functional venue space.</p>
